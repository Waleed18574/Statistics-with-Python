This doesn't have much significance on its own: while the difference between the populations will be computed the same way in both analysis (unpooled and pooled variance analysis), we also need to account for the degrees of freedom are different in both cases. We need to know both the effect the degrees of freedom has on the t-distribution for the test statistic as well as the standard error if we are going to compute the full effect.\n",

    "When we ran a test comparing an individual to themselves, as we did in part a, we were running a really interesting study called a paired study. In this type of study, you use an individual as their own control group. This type of control allows researches to account for individual differences more precisely -- when you have the option to do so, often a paired study will have the highest power because it is able to control for all of the the things that make an individual unique: many of these things may not be controlled in the study in question. \n",

You are now not comparing an individual to themselves. Rather, you are treating all of the measurements of the first diastolic pressure as independent from the second diastolic pressure measure. \n",

When doing the independent t-test, we notice there is no significant difference. When you are setting up your study, you should always be careful and aware of how you chose to measure your subjects, what measures you are including, and how to best control for covariates that are outside of your control. In general, you should be thinking about the statistics all throughout the experimental process and not just at the end when you have all of your data. "
